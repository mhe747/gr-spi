 
These files are part of the plugin gr-spi of GNU Radio for BeagleSDR (https://github.com/mhe747/dawnboard)
GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. 
It can be used with readily-available low-cost external BeagleSDR RF hardware on top of Beagleboard X15 in order to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. 
It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.

 
 These files are part of the plugin gr-spi of GNU Radio for BeagleSDR
 GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. 
 It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. 
 It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.
